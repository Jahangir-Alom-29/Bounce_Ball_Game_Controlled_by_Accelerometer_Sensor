# Bounce Ball Game with Accelerometer Sensor 

This project is a simple Bounce Ball game where an accelerometer controls the movement of the paddle. The goal is to keep the ball above the paddleâ€”if it hits the ground, the game is over.  

## Features  
- Accelerometer-based paddle movement  
- Real-time game mechanics  
- Game-over condition when the ball falls  

## Components Used  
- Arduino (Any compatible board)  
- Accelerometer (e.g., ADXL335, MPU6050)  
- LCD display or serial monitor for output
